# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

For this solution I used HTML & CSS with a little flexbox and the gap property.
